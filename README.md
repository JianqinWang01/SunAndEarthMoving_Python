## Name
 Solar System Planet Moving Style_Python
## Description
This system simulates planets moving around sun along their orbits periodically.Planets moving speed is non-uniform and mimic the trajectory of their motion 
forced by gravity in Solar System.
## Detailed Description
It is based on pyqtgraph package which provide convenient function to draw graph.Animation is created by a timer which periodically update the position of the planets.
Planet Orbit was calculated by the following equations:<br/>
* <b>Inner orbit-Circle:</b><br>
<b>X<sup>2</sup>+Y<sup>2</sup>=R<sup>2</sup></b>
* <b>Outter orbit-Oval:</b><br>a
<b>X<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup>+Y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>=1
